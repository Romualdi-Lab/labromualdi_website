# Multi Omics Survival Clip

**MOSClip** is a new method that combines survival analysis and graphical model theory to test the survival association of pathways or of their connected components in a multi-omic framework. Multi-omic gene measurements are tested as covariates of a Cox proportional hazard model after dimensionality reduction of data. The final goal is to find the biological processes impacting the patient's survival.
