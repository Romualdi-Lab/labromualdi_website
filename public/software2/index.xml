      <description>&lt;p&gt;gINTomics is an R package for Multi-Omics data integration and visualization. gINTomics is designed to detect the association between the expression of a target and of its regulators, taking into account also their genomics modifications such as Copy Number Variations (CNV) and methylation. For RNA sequencing data, the counts will be fitted using a negative binomial model, while in the case of microarray or other types of data, a linear model will be applied. In some cases the number of regulators for a given target could be very high, in order to handle this eventuality, we provide a penalized linear model that will automatically keep only the most important regulators. All the models are gene-specific, so each gene/miRNA will have its own model with its covariates. The package will automatically download information about TF-target couples (dorothea), miRNA-target couples (multiMiR) and TF-miRNA couples (TransmiR). The couples will be used to define the covariates used in the integration models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;BrewerIX is a standardized approach for the analysis of known imprinted and X-linked genes. Differently from other tools, its implementation strategy allows the user (i) to perform fast and efficient analyses from raw data to the final plots on a standard desktop or laptop computer without requiring any programming skills, (ii) to have comprehensive information of imprinted and X-linked genes taken from different databases that have been manually curated to avoid results misinterpretation, (iii) to graphically visualize the results in an easy and intuitive way. All these features will guarantee the reproducibility of results and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrewerIX is implemented as a native graphical application for Linux and macOS. It takes as input either bulk or single-cell RNA-seq data (fastq files), analyzes reads mapped over the SNVs distributed on imprinted genes (see “Knowledge base” section for details), X chromosome and Y chromosome, and generates imprinting and XCI profiles of each sample.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Implements topological gene set analysis using a two-step empirical approach. It exploits graph decomposition theory to create a junction tree and reconstruct the most relevant signal path. In the first step clipper selects significant pathways according to statistical tests on the means and the concentration matrices of the graphs derived from pathway topologies. Then, it &amp;ldquo;clips&amp;rdquo; the whole pathway identifying the signal paths having the greatest association with a specific phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The conversion procedure that create the networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The R package that allows the use and the analyses of the network within the BioC platform,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Web tool GraphiteWeb that allows the use and the analyses of the network directly on the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BioC graphite package is constantly updated and available at the BioC site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GraphiteWeb is freely available here and is based on the graphite BioC package and on our pathway analysis pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;miRNAs have been extensively studied and hundreds of target genes have been found. However, despite all these efforts, signaling pathways that are the formal description of biological circuits, contain very few miRNAs. This penalizes pathway analyses, widely used and essential approaches to enhance transcriptome measurements interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this limitation we developed micrographite, an R pipeline able to integrate pathway information with predicted and validated miRNA–target interactions and to perform integrated topological analyses of miRNA and gene expression profiles to identify miRNA–gene circuits.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;MOSClip ((Multi-Omics Survival Clip) is a multi-omic statistical approach based on pathway topology. It exploits the topology of pathway annotations and integrates multi-omics data to identify pathways or pathway modules associated with right-censored survival data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOSClip is implemented as an R package. It is highly flexible, accepting from one to many omics datasets, also allowing the use and combination of different data reduction strategies. It furthermore contains several tools to graphically summarize the results and help the user during data interpretation. These features make MOSClip a useful and versatile tool for omics integration analyses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PsiNorm, a between-sample normalization method based on the power-law Pareto distribution parameter estimate. We show that Pareto distribution well resembles scRNA-seq data, especially those coming from platforms that employ unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated by this result, we implement PsiNorm, a simple and highly scalable normalization method. We benchmark PsiNorm against seven other methods in terms of cluster identification, concordance and computational resources required. We demonstrate that PsiNorm is among the top performing methods showing a good trade-off between accuracy and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;simPATHy is a model for simulating data from perturbed biological pathways. It is implemented as an  R package and produces synthetic datasets useful to validate GSA methods focused on topological properties of biological networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a graph structure representing a biological network, functions in simPATHy allow simulating data in two different conditions. The two conditions, assumed to share the same graphical structure, are referred to as reference and dysregulated condition. Dysregulation is defined as a change in the strength of the links between network nodes. Such changes can be interpreted as activation/deactivation of network connections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SourceSet is a statisticla method to distinguish between the primary and the secondary dysregulation within a Gaussian graphical model context. It compares gene expression profiles in the control and in the perturbed condition and detects the differences in both the mean and the covariance parameters with a series of likelihood ratio tests. The resulting evidence is used to infer the primary and the secondary set, i.e. the genes responsible for the primary dysregulation, and the genes affected by the perturbation through network propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SourceSet demonstrates high specificity and sensitivity in different simulated scenarios and on several real biological case studies. In order to fit into the more traditional pathway analysis framework, SourceSet R package also extends the analysis from a single to multiple pathways and provides several graphical outputs, including Cytoscape visualization to browse the results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using Gaussian graphical models we propose a novel approach to perform pathway analysis using gene expression. Given the structure of a graph (a pathway) we introduce two statistical tests to compare the mean and the concentration matrices between two groups. Specifically, these tests can be performed on the graph and on its connected components (cliques).&lt;/p&gt;
