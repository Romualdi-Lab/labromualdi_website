# Education and research activity

BS degree with honours in Statistical Sciences in 1996 at the University of Padova.

Ph.D. degree in Statistic at the University of Padova in 2001.
The research activity pertained to multivariate statistical methodologies applied to population genetics. In particular, the performance of different machine learning techniques, specifically adapted to the problem of the affiliation of multilocus genotypes, has been tested through simulated and real data.

PostDoc fellow at the Department of Biology of the University of Padova from 2001 to the end of 2004.
The focus of the research was on the study and development of new statistical methodologies in the field of gene expression data derived either by tag sampling and microarray experiments. At the same time, she starts working on bioinformatics for the development of open source databases and web tools for the analysis of molecular data from high-throughput technologies.

Assistant Professor of Statistic at the University of Padova from January 2005 to November 2014.

Associate Professor of molecular biology at the University of Padova from November 2014 to January 2023.

Since January 2023 she is Professor of molecular biology at the University of Padova.
