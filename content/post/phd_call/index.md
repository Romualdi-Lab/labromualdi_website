### Crosstalk of Cancer Genome and Tumor Microenvironment in Ovarian Cancer Metastases at Single-Cell Resolution

**Contact:** Prof. Chiara Romualdi â€“ [chiara.romualdi@unipd.it](mailto:chiara.romualdi@unipd.it)

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced metastatic stage. Metastases form a complex ecosystem of diverse, interacting cells, whose genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity shapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) and drives tumor aggressiveness. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms underlying tumorâ€“TME crosstalk remain poorly understood. This PhD project aims to investigate the dynamic interplay between cancer genomes and TME composition in primary tumors and matched metastases across different histological subtypes.
The selected candidate will use **computational approaches** to analyze **genomic and transcriptomic data at single-cell resolution**, comparing primary and metastatic tumor sites.
