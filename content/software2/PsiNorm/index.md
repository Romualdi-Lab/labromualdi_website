PsiNorm, a between-sample normalization method based on the power-law Pareto distribution parameter estimate. We show that Pareto distribution well resembles scRNA-seq data, especially those coming from platforms that employ unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). 

Motivated by this result, we implement PsiNorm, a simple and highly scalable normalization method. We benchmark PsiNorm against seven other methods in terms of cluster identification, concordance and computational resources required. We demonstrate that PsiNorm is among the top performing methods showing a good trade-off between accuracy and scalability.
