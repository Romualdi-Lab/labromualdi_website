Welcome to Romualdi Lab, our goal is to unravel the biology of life systems through the power of computational methods, specifically leveraging the integration of different omics data.

We develop innovative tools and adopt state-of-the-art computational approaches to investigate molecular alterations in complex diseases and how these alterations might influence disease progression.
